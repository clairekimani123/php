/*PHP TUTORIAL-it simple AND FLEXIBLE TO USE*/
//This is a comment
    /*for a multline  we use this*/
    //the good thing about php   it can contain html, js, react code

 //FLOAT = it is a floating number that contain decimald number, they are aslo into percentage.
    //if you want to have an output of  the price in dollar or shs. you need to use backeslide example 
    //BOOLEAN = it's either true or false
    //it's out put is not either true or false naah,, if sthg s true it will give you an output of 1 and if it's false  it will a zero like nothing in thr our put just the words Online status: 
    //you can mix variable or add them.
/*
    PHP is a server-side scripting language designed primarily for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language.
    It is a powerful tool for making dynamic and interactive web pages.
    PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter, which generates HTML that is sent to the client's browser.
    PHP can be embedded into HTML, making it easy to add functionality to web pages.

/*
//this is an introduction to php now we going to do variables
//variables =  it is a reusable container that holds data, string, integer, float, boolean
//to decalre a variable you start with a dollar sign then a unique name a niques identifier
*/
//  to display our output we use "echo" and print is_int(): Checks if a variable is an integer.
//is_int(): Checks if a variable is an integer.
//is_string(): Checks if a variable is a string.
//is_array(): Checks if a variable is an array.
//--is_object(): Checks if a variable is an object.
//is_bool(): Checks if a variable is a boolean.
//(): Checks if a variable is NULL.

3. Date and Time Functions
//date(): Returns the current date or time.
//strtotime(): Converts a string into a Unix timestamp.
//time(): Returns the current Unix timestamp.

2. Array Functions
//array_push(): Adds elements to the end of an array.
//array_pop(): Removes the last element of an array.
//array_merge(): Merges two or more arrays.


1. String Functions
//strlen(): Returns the length of a string.
//strtoupper(): Converts a string to uppercase.
//strtolower(): Converts a string to lowercase.
//substr(): Returns a part of a string.

//it is a loosely language meaning you don't need to declarethe dat type of  a variable
//displaying a whole string directly is called literal string an o display a sentence like hello clara we use curry blaces with thr variable name inside.
